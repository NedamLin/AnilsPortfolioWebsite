					<h5>Introduction to coding</h5>
					<div class="pra">
						<p>I was first introduced to writing code when I was given the task to predict the trajectory of objects with drag through a series of differential equations. While on this project I learned how we can build and simulate real events on a computer, which would normally be difficult to achieve if we were to carry out in the real world. I could see the time/cost saved whilst also having an easier time working around the parameters that had to be measured and changed. I derive a great deal of satisfaction from the challenge of applying coding skills to practical, real-world problems.
  Once I left university I wanted a more creative outlet whilst also not allowing the problem-solving skillet to go to waste. This is where I discovered web development. I began using online resources like Udemy FreeCodeCamp and many more alike to learn how to code and develop web applications. I wanted to create visually appealing web applications but also understand how the code allows for the application to function.
